# Mindfulness


## The Purpose of Mindfulness is to...
 Enhance awareness of the present moment, without reacting out of emotion.
 Learn to accept thoughts and emotions as natural events that you don't have to control.
 Break the habit of reacting to thoughts and emotions. Just because a thought or emotion
comes up does not mean you have to follow it, believe it, or act on it.

## Mindfulness is not...
 Mindlessness, or allowing your mind to wander aimlessly.
 A form of relaxation or positive thinking, although this may happen anyway.
 About changing or leaving an experience, even though it might be uncomfortable.

### Why it matters 
 Training mindfulness can increase attention and working memory
 People who practice mindfulness are less likely to suffer from depression, PTSD, and reckless behavior (like binge drinking)

# Mindfulness Techniques
## Focus on your breathing
Try focusing on your breathing for 60 seconds.
If (when) your attention wanders, just acknowledge it and bring your attention back on breathing.

add 30-45 seconds every few days until you can do it for 12-15 minutes.
Benefits start to show after practicing for 15 minutes, 5 times per week, for 4 weeks.
