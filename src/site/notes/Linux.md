Linux is a Unix-like, [[202503252114|free and open source]] operating system. Typically interfaced with a [[202503252117|command line interface]], but many Linux [[distros]] have a desktop environment.  

[[Commands]] in Linux are executed in the order in which they are found in the [[PATH]] [[environment variable]].
