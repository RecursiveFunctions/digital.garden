# Shared Objects
Â SOs (Shared Objects) are dynamic link libraries that contain executable code. They're the Linux equivalent of Windows DLLs, serving as modular components that programs can load and execute at runtime.
These shared objects are particularly significant in exploitation because they:

- Contain executable code that can be manipulated
- Run with the privileges of the loading process
- Can be injected into running programs
- Provide persistent presence in memory

The security implications are substantial - SOs create potential attack surfaces through:

- Dynamic loading vulnerabilities
- Library preloading attacks
- Code injection vectors
- Privilege escalation paths

they represent a critical attack surface in Linux systems, similar to how DLLs are targeted in Windows environments.
