# Userland
Userland refers to the portion of a computer system that operates in user space, outside the [[202503252109|kernel]]'s privileged domain. It encompasses all programs, libraries, and processes that run with standard user privileges, isolated from direct hardware access and kernel operations.

The userland environment includes:

- Application binaries and scripts
- Shared libraries and frameworks
- User processes and services
- System utilities and tools

This architectural separation serves as a fundamental security boundary, preventing userland processes from directly manipulating critical system resources while maintaining controlled access through well-defined kernel interfaces.
