The `apropos` command helps users discover commands when they're unsure of the exact name or want to explore related functionalities.

it examines the one-line descriptions stored in the [[202503262150|whatis]] database. These descriptions are essentially the brief summaries that appear at the top of man pages, and `apropos` uses them to help you find commands related to your search terms
