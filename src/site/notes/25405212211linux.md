# ELF

The ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) specification describes the binary format used for executable files in Linux systems. ELF32 and ELF64 represent the 32-bit and 64-bit variants of this format, which serve as the foundation for program execution on Linux platforms.

## Components
- Header structures defining file properties and architecture requirements
- Program headers containing memory layout and loading instructions
- Section headers organizing code and data segments
- Dynamic linking tables for shared library dependencies

## Formats
These formats present distinct characteristics:

### ELF32

- Limited to 4GB virtual address space
- Simpler memory layout
- More constrained register set
- Legacy system compatibility requirements

### ELF64:

- Expanded address space
- Enhanced register architecture
- Additional security features
- Modern exploitation mitigations

## Security Implications

- ELF32's restricted address space creates predictable memory layouts
- ELF64's expanded address space implements address space layout randomization (ASLR)
- Different NOP sled requirements due to address space size
- Varying buffer overflow exploitation complexity

This distinction is crucial for exploitation because attack techniques must be specifically tailored to the target binary's ELF format, with ELF64 binaries typically presenting additional security challenges due to their enhanced protection mechanisms and larger address space.
