This is basically my [[202503280325|2nd brain]]. Collecting my thoughts and notes and structuring it in a way that connects concepts and ideas through bidirectional linking. Since digital gardens are a continuous work in progress, expect a lot of broken links as you meander through here. If you encounter one, just know it's because I intend to flesh out that idea at a later date. Over time those links will lead to new notes as I eventually port over my knowledge base. This digital garden in particular is somewhere between a blog and a knowledge management system, but I intend to write and design primarily for myself.

This site is created using [[Obsidian]] , the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), and deployed with [vercel](https://vercel.com/). Underneath the hood, I use [[eleventy]] and [[nunjucks]].
