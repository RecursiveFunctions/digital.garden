# locate
>[!info]  The mlocate package is no longer included by default in  Ubuntu 20.04

| command | syntax          | description                                                   |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| locate  | `locate <file>` | returns the file location of <file> by referencing `locatedb` |

`updatedb` indexes your system and creates a static database to quickly find your files with O(1) lookup time. 
* you can update the `mlocate` database with the `updatedb` command
![caution] **updatedb** is CPU intensive

The database that `locate` creates and references is not updated automatically when , so if you create new files, `locate` won't be able to find them until you run `updatedb` again to re-index your system.

similarly, deleted files are not automatically removed, and running `locate` on a recently deleted file will return the path where it used to be located.
