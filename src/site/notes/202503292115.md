# Naive Realism
> [Naive Realism](https://dasniel.com/philosophy)  [🏛️](https://web.archive.org/web/20250330/https://dasniel.com/philosophy) is the belief that we see reality as it truly is and is a default cognitive stance for most of us.[^1]

Naive Realism leads people to overestimate how much their opponents understand their perspective. So it may feel like the other person isn't just disagreeing with you or misinformed, . [they're actively choosing to be wrong](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10352116/) [🏛️](https://web.archive.org/web/20250330/https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10352116/)
