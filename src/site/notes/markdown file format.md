Text files created with Markdown language dialects are saved with  the **.md** or **.MARKDOWN** file extension. MD files are saved in plain text format that uses Markdown language which also includes inline text symbols, defining how a text can be formatted such as indentations, table formatting, fonts, and headers.  MD files can be converted to HTML with a program called Markdown.

You can open .md files with any text editor and view them as plaintext notes.
