# Fixed Fire
![Fixed Fire](/src/site/img/Pasted%20image%2020250404212855.png)

Fixed Fire is delivered against a stationary point target when the depth and width of the [[beaten zone]] covers the target with little or no manipulation needed. After the initial burst, the gunners follow any change or movement of the target without command.
