# Traversing Fire
Traversing fire disperses fires in width by successive changes in direction, but not elevation. It is delivered against a wide target with minimal detph. When engaging a wide target requiring traversing fire, the gunner should select successive aiming points throughout the target area. These aiming points should be close enough together to ensure adequate target  coverage. However they do not need to be so close that they waste ammunition by concentrating a heavy volume of fire in a small area.
