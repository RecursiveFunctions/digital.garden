# Free Gun
Free gunfire is delivered against moving targets that are rapidly engaged with fast changes in direction and elevation.

Examples are aerial targets, vehicles, mounted troops, or enemy soldiers in relatively close formations moving rapidly toward or away from the gun position. When firing free gun, the weapon is normally fired at the cyclic rate of fire.
