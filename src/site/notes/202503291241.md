# Change your exif data on your images

The metadata contained in images could be used to track you down. It includes things like the make and model of your phone, when the picture was taken, or even GPS coordinates. On Windows you can right click a photo and check its properties for the metadata or view it in the Photos app and select info.

It's kinda nuts. Imagine casually taking a selfie in your own home, uploading it on social media and now anyone could find out your address. 

## Edit or Remove your metadata
In windows I can change or remove the values in the properties menu outright. But that's tedious. This inspired me to create a proof of concept [ Python-based image metadata randomizer](https://github.com/RecursiveFunctions/ImageMetaDataRandomizer) . It basically creates a modified copy of your image with randomized meta data, and even changes up the dimensions a little bit so viewers can't even narrow it down using that information. It's a little less obvious than outright removing your Exif data, but the GPS coordinates would probably give it away since it's completely randomized. Any valid set of coordinates could be generated, so your image could be 'taken' in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean for example.
