# Find

## Syntax

| command | syntax                               | description                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| find    | `find <path> -name <file>`           | searches the filesystem with the given string              |
|         | `find <path> -name <file> [command]` | runs the given command on the file-paths that find returns |
unlike the `locate` command, `find` will do a 'live' search through your system and return all paths that contain the given string. Results are up to date, so if you create or delete a file and then run a search, the results from `find` will reflect that. 

`find` is a more granular type of search.
>[!caution] **find** is CPU intensive compared to **[[202503301028|locate]]**

## Examples
`find / -name *.conf` - returns a list of all file-paths that contain the string `.conf` (so basically all the .conf files)

`sudo find / -name '*.tmp -exec wc -l "{ }" \;` performs a live search for all files with .tmp in the name, starting at the `/` path. it returns all the file-paths that that match the search, then it runs `wc -l " "` on each of those paths in order. Or simply put, it finds all .tmp files in the entire system and counts the number of lines in each file
