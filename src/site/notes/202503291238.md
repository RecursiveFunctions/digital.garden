# Tor
## Use Tor 
### Download Tor
### desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux) and Android
[Tor Project | Anonymity Online](https://www.torproject.org/)

### iOS 
[Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com/)
[Orbot](https://orbot.app/en/)

* there's a handful of Tor browsers in the appstore but these are actually [endorsed](https://support.torproject.org/tormobile/tormobile-3/) by the Tor Project
* Check their [Github repository](https://github.com/OnionBrowser/OnionBrowser) for documentation
>[!caution]  iOS forces all browsers to use WebKit framework, limiting full Tor protection

    participant Client
    participant Entry as Entry Node
    participant Middle as Middle Node
    participant Exit as Exit Node
    participant Web as Website
    
    Note over Client,Web: Encryption Process
    Client->>Entry: Triple-Encrypted Message
    Entry->>Middle: Double-Encrypted Message
    Middle->>Exit: Single-Encrypted Message
    Exit->>Web: Decrypted Message
    
    Note over Client,Web: Return Path
    Web->>Exit: Response
    Exit->>Middle: Single-Encrypted Response
    Middle->>Entry: Double-Encrypted Response
    Entry->>Client: Triple-Encrypted Response
    
    Note over Client,Web: Security Benefits
    Note over Entry: Knows sender,<br/>not destination
    Note over Middle: Knows neither<br/>sender nor destination
    Note over Exit: Knows destination,<br/>not sender
```
- Your data gets wrapped in three layers of encryption
- Each node peels off exactly one layer - they can only see the next hop, nothing else
- Entry Node knows who you are but not where you're going
- Middle Node is just a relay station
- Exit Node sees the destination but has no idea who sent it

### Initial Setup
Launch Tor Browser and you'll hit the connection screen. Choose "Connect" unless you're dealing with censorship or proxy issues. If you're behind a restrictive network, click "Configure" to set up bridges.

>[!info] If you're dealing with heavy censorship
>
>- Use the  [Connection Assist](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/) feature to automatically grab a bridge
>- Set up [Pluggable Transports](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-configure-use-tor-browser-securely-comprehensive-guide-denys-spys-6jijf) (obfs4 is solid) 
>- Request custom bridges if the defaults are blocked

### Verification

Make sure it's working:

1. Hit [check.torproject.org](https://check.torproject.org/) to verify your [connection](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-configure-use-tor-browser-securely-comprehensive-guide-denys-spys-6jijf)
2. Run a [DNS leak test](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-configure-use-tor-browser-securely-comprehensive-guide-denys-spys-6jijf) 
3. Check your circuit info by clicking the lock icon
