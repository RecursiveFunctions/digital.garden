# Large Language Models
Large language models are built by using supervised learning to train a model to repeatedly predict the next word. For example, if an AI system has read on the Internet a sentence like my favorite drink is lychee bubble tea, then the single sentence would be turned into a lot of A to B data points for the model to learn to predict the next word.
