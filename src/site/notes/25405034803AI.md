# Supervised Learning
The most commonly used type of machine learning is a type of AI that learns 
A to B or input to output mappings, and this is called supervised learning.

If the input A is an email and the output B you want is, is this email spam or not? 0/1. Then this is the core piece of AI used to build a spam filter. Or if the input A is an audio clip and the AI's job is output the text transcript, then this is speech recognition. More examples, if you want to input English and have it output a different language, Chinese, Spanish, something else, then this is machine translation

Supervised learning also lies at the heart of generative AI systems, like the ChatGPT and chat bots that generate texts. These systems work by learning from huge amounts of texts. You download them from the Internet so that when given a few words as the input, the model can predict the next word that comes after. These models, which are called large language models or LLMs, generate new texts by repeatedly predicting what is the next word they should output.
