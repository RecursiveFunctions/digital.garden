# Digital Garden Graph Customization

I wanted to change up the functionality of the graph so that I could hide nodes or change their titles. Since I'm trying to switch over to a more zettelkasten style of note taking, I don't want the nodes in my graph to have names like these
![Screenshot 2025-03-25 233759.png](/src/site/img/Screenshot%202025-03-25%20233759.png)

So instead I defined custom properties to use a user-provided title for the node when the graph is generated.
## Custom Graph Titles

You can use the `dg-graph-title` property to customize how nodes appear in the graph:

```yaml
---
dg-graph-title: "Custom Graph Label"
---
```

Without this property, nodes will display using:
1. Regular `title` property if available
2. Filename as fallback

## Excluding Notes from Graph

To completely hide a note from the graph, add:

```yaml
---
dg-graph-exclude: true
---
```

When this property is set to `true`:
- The note won't appear in the graph
- Links to this note won't be displayed
- Links from this note won't be displayed

This is useful for notes that:
- Are utility/reference pages
- Would create excessive visual noise
- Shouldn't be connected in the knowledge graph

## Technical Implementation

These features were implemented by modifying the `getGraph()` function in `src/helpers/linkUtils.js`. The changes:

1. Added support for `dg-graph-title` to customize node labels
2. Created an `excludedNodes` set to track excluded notes
3. Modified node creation to respect `dg-graph-exclude: true`
4. Added filtering of links to exclude connections to hidden nodes
5. Made sure string values (`"true"`) are handled the same as boolean values

The updated code uses:
```javascript
// Use custom graph title or fall back to defaults
title: v.data["dg-graph-title"] || v.data.title || v.fileSlug,

// Check for excluded notes (handles both boolean and string values)
if (v.data["dg-graph-exclude"] === true || v.data["dg-graph-exclude"] === "true") {
  excludedNodes.add(v.url);
  return;
}
```
