# Trying to fix transclusion

`![[\test\]]`

![[test]](/src/site/notes/test)

I'm fairly certain that transclusions weren't working because I used Cursor AI to make some modifications that inadvertently screwed up the functionality of it early on. But after nearly a week of debugging (also with AI) I actually came out of it with
1) the features I wanted (auto-populating my daily notes, expanded graph options, more forgiving internal link syntax, etc)
2) A better understanding of the underlying codebase for the digital garden plugin 
3) An appreciation for better prompting for better results (ie don't just ctrl+v errors and say 'fix pls'....okay, well I still do that, but I also ask followup questions)
4) an ironed out workflow for cultivating my digital garden 
5) proper transclusions

coding aside, I think with recent events pertaining to the US Government, I should refresh my education on civics and how the government works. I'm hearing soundbites like "Those judges weren't elected!" and that might sway someone who is completely ignorant of our governmental institutions. Which is to say, damn near everyone, apparently. 

## why does it matter anyway?
- I want to discern for myself if the actions our leaders are taking are legal, ethical, and moral within the boundaries of the US [[202503280149|Constitution]]
- I want to hold them accountable, because accountability doesn't disappear with rank

on a related note, I keep hearing the term [[fascist]] / [[fascism]] thrown around and I haven't really taken the time to learn exactly what it is beyond `fascism = bad` , so that's also on my list of things to study.
