# Vercel limits on the free plan
Turns out I'm limited to 100 deployments a day on  the free plan. Now for a hobbyist that should be plenty, but I actually reached the daily limit a [[Daily Notes/2025-03-22|The other day]] trying to figure out the transclusion issue.

    subgraph "Local Deployment"
        direction TB
        Dev1[/"Source Code"/] --> Build1["Local Build"]
        Build1 --> Server1["Local Server"]
        Server1 --> Browser1["Local Browser"]
        
        style Dev1 fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b,color:#000000

        style Browser1 fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#4a148c,color:#000000
    end

```
