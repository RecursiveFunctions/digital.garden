# This can't be real.
Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic magazine, was accidentally added to a Signal group chat where top US officials were discussing plans for U.S. military strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

The timeline of events reads like a plot from a political satire:

- **March 11**: Goldberg receives a message request on Signal from National Security Adviser Mike Waltz (or someone claiming to be him).
- **March 14**: A "long conversation" occurs in the group chat about potential military action in Yemen.
- **March 15**: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shares what Goldberg characterized as "war plans" in the chat, including a "sequencing of events" for an upcoming attack on Yemen. Hours later, the strikes actually happen, with congratulatory messages and emojis flowing in the chat.
- **March 24**: Goldberg publishes his bombshell article in The Atlantic titled "The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans."
- **March 26**: The Atlantic publishes screenshots showing Hegseth's messages detailing launch times for F-18s and Tomahawk missiles.

## The Security Implications

From a cybersecurity perspective, this is what we in the computer science field technically call "a complete disaster." Consider:

1. Signal is an encrypted messaging app, but it's still a consumer application not designed for sharing [[202503261649|sensitive military information]].
2. NSA Director Timothy Haugh confirmed Signal has vulnerabilities and testified that the shared information "would be classified" had it been intercepted from Russia or China.
3. The administration's Russia negotiator, Steve Witkoff, was reportedly in Russia while participating in this chat.

As Senator Richard Blumenthal put it: "This is information at the very top of the pyramid as to what should be kept secret and classified." 

This incident perfectly illustrates the tension between convenience and security in our digital age. Yes, Signal offers end-to-end encryption, but proper operational security involves much more than just encrypted messages. It requires secure channels, proper classification protocols, and most importantly, not accidentally adding journalists to your war planning group chats.

In Cybersecurity, we often say humans are the weakest link. This case study will likely appear in cybersecurity textbooksâ€”right next to "don't use 'password123' as your password" and "Nigerian princes probably don't need your bank account information."
