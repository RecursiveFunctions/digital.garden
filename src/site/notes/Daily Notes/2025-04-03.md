# AI Tools Presentation AAR
I'd say it went fairly well. I had a couple of live demos fail on me, even though I had rehearsed several times beforehand. Such is the nature of live demos. I did get some good feedback that I'll carry into next week's presentation. I like the idea of doing an After Action Review (AAR) so I can improve.
### Start with an agenda
Give the audience the BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front). Tell them what you hope they take away from the presentation. 

### The audience is there to learn, not to judge
So don't be nervous. Also someone pointed out that a classic sign of nervousness is getting extremely loud. I thought being loud = confidence, but they saw through my facade. Gotta keep my voice appropriate to the audience size and setting (small classroom).

### Don't read off the slide
While I'm pretty good at articulating myself using the slide deck, it's distracting for the audience to have to read all that text while listening to me. This leads into the next bit.

### Reduce amount of text in slides
that's fair. I should keep just the main points.

### Have a backup for the live demos
I liked the suggestion of having a video recording of what right looks like, in case the demo doesn't work.
