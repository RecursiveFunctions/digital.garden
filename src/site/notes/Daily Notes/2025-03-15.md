When I changed the theme of my site to minimal a few days ago, something broke and I was unable to deploy further updates. 
the log shows this in vercel

I don't really want to spend a lot of time debugging this while I'm on vacation so I'll just keep making notes until I can make time to resolve this.

My eyes tend to glaze over when looking at logs like this, but this might be a clue
```
[02:11:28.200] [11ty] Output conflict: multiple input files are writing to `dist/index.html`. Use distinct `permalink` values to resolve this conflict.
[02:11:28.200] [11ty]   1. ./src/site/notes/src/site/notes/About.md
[02:11:28.200] [11ty]   2. ./src/site/notes/About.md (via DuplicatePermalinkOutputError)
```

There are multiple copies of my [[About\|About]] page for some reason, so I deleted the copies and that seemed to resolve the issue.

----
sooo the site deployed, but now most of the pages redirect back to my [[About\|About]] page. What's going on here? I took a look my vault again in obsidian

Maybe I need to have my src file copy the same structure as my vault??

---------
nope, when I did that it failed to deploy.

Maybe I should just go back to the last successful deployment.

I need to learn more about markdown file format. I should create a note about that.
