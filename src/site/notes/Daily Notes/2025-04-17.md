## Components of an ELF File

An ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file is a standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps on Unix-like systems. Here's a breakdown of its main components:

    0-15: "ELF Header (52/64 bytes)"
    16-31: "Program Header Table"
    32-47: "Section Header Table"
    48-63: "Data Sections"
    64-79: "Program Segments"
    80-95: "Section Data"
```
**Simplified Visual Representation**

```
+-------------------+
| ELF Header        |
+-------------------+
| Program Header    |  -+
| Table             |   |
+-------------------+   | Loadable segments
| Section 1         |   |
+-------------------+   |
| Section 2         |   |
+-------------------+   |
| ...               |   |
+-------------------+   |
| Section n         |   |
+-------------------+   |
| Section Header    |  -+
| Table             |
+-------------------+
```

**Key Points**

- The ELF header is always at the beginning of the file.
    
- The program header table and section header table are arrays of fixed-size structures.
    
- Sections contain the actual data and code of the program.
    
- Segments, described by the program header table, are a way of grouping sections for loading into memory.
    
- Not all sections are loaded into memory; some are used during linking or debugging.
    
- Tools like `readelf`, `objdump`, and `gdb` can be used to inspect the contents of an ELF file.
