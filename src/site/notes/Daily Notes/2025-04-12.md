# Starting another project with AI assistance
Instead of jumping headfirst into Cursor IDE for this project, I thought it'd be prudent to plan out the details using Phind first.

## complete reset
When I jumped into cursor to modify this site I didn't take the time to fully understand the underlying architecture. in spite of documenting the changes I can't really make heads or tails of what's what anymore. I've gone back to a clean slate so I can do things in a more organized fasion. I'm thinking of documenting everything in a way that makes sense to me, before letting an AI model loose on my site again.
