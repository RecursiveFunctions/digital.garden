# Sunday Bug Fixes

## Graph Center Positioning Fix

Today I fixed an issue where nodes were incorrectly appearing from the top-left corner of the screen instead of from the center as intended:

1. **Root Cause **:
   - Identified that the initial node positioning was being overridden during the rendering process
   - Discovered that D3's default behavior was causing nodes to shift before the staggered animation began
   - Found that the simulation was running automatically before we could set positions correctly

2. **Complete Position Control Implementation**:
   - Explicitly stopped the force simulation at initialization to prevent automatic movement
   - Set alpha to 0 initially to keep nodes stationary until intentionally moved
   - Force-positioned all visual elements (nodes, labels, links) at exact center coordinates
   - Added immediate position updates within the staggered animation sequence

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Made labels initially invisible, fading them in as their nodes appear
   - Created a more controlled expansion from center effect
   - Implemented direct position control during the animation sequence
   - Ensured links follow nodes properly during the animation

4. **Animation Improvements**:
   - Created rapid-fire node population within each depth level (20ms intervals)
   - Implemented 800ms pauses between depth groups for visual clarity
   - Increased random offsets for more dramatic, energetic movement
   - Applied higher alpha values to make nodes "pop" into place

This fix ensures nodes now properly spawn from the center of the graph in a visually appealing, intentional pattern, rather than appearing from the top-left corner of the screen.
