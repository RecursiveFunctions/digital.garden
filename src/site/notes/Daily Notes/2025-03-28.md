# Got a domain for the digital garden
The url is now recursivefunctions.dev 
I'll probably add some online tools and give them their own subdomain.
It's kinda stupid but I feel a little more professional and proud to have my own .dev domain, even though I should probably feel more proud about cultivating my own site instead, since this is way more effort and an ongoing process.
