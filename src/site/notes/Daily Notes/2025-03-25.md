# Might as well learn the framework
I originally went with the digital garden plugin so I didn't have to think about the underlying framework. Ironically, once I decided I wanted something like my daily notes being [[AI/Fixing Daily Notes sort order with AI|programmatically sorted and displayed from newest to oldest]], I spent more time screwing around with my site instead of putting up more notes. but is that such a bad thing? I suppose it just takes my learning in a different direction.

Reviewed some notes on [[202503250814|Mindfulness]] .

added [[202503252330|graph generation and hidden graph nodes]] to my site. Still can't get transclusions to work though! It should work right out of the box, but I suspect when I gave cursor some leeway to make changes to the javascript and nunjucks files it broke something. Alas!
