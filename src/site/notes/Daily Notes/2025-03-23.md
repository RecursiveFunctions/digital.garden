# Transitioning to Zettelkasten
Instead of using Supermemo as my knowledge base, I want to transition to using obsidian and [the Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) , while keeping supermemo around for incremental reading. 

> The difference between regular note-taking systems and a Zettelkasten is the emphasis on forming relationships. A Zettelkasten makes connecting and not collecting a priority. The difference between just a text and hypertext is that the former is linear and the latter is organic.

>There are three components that each Zettel has:
>
>A unique identifier. This gives your Zettel an unambiguous address.
>
>The body of the Zettel. This is where you write down what you want to capture: The piece of knowledge.
>
>References. At the bottom of each Zettel, you either reference the source of the knowledge you capture or leave it blank if you capture your own thoughts.

There's a plugin in [obsidian/|Obsidian] for that. moving forward I should probably just use that plugin to create the notes with a unique identifier. I'll leave my existing notes untouched for now.
