# AI Tools Presentation 2
Some observations for the next presentation
* Get proficient with using an onscreen magnifier
	* some parts of the demo were text heavy and the audience couldn't some of the small fonts. this lead to an unengaging portion of the demo
* Find more ways to relate the information to the audience
	* Ranger knowledge was an easy go-to
	* Try to identify audience ahead of time to incorporate examples specific to them (logistics, cybersecurity, intel, etc)

As excited as I was to showcase the cursor IDE tool, only one other person in the audience realistically had anything to do with programming. I should balance what I want to share with what will matter most to the audience.

The conversational speech model was probably the biggest hit, and the spookiest. I could tell this sent some alarm bells ringing in some peoples heads on how fast AI is developing.

Not entirely sure I was concise and simple enough on the technical jargon. I think I should add more *relevant* and informative visualizations.
