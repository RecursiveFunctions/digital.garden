# Troubleshooting transclusion
>[!info] I eventually fixed this bullshit on [[2025-03-27]]


Currently having trouble making a transcluded note appear in the [[src/site/notes/About|About]] page. ideally it should like this 

```markdown
![[2025-03-21#Transitioning from supermemo]]
```
![[2025-03-21#Transitioning from supermemo]] 

###### The issue
I think the issue is that my about page and note I'm trying to transclude are in different folders. Either that or I just don't know how to put in the correct path leading to the note I want to transclude. When I transclude notes and view it offline in my vault it looks just fine.
```markdown
![[src/site/notes/About|About]]
```
![[src/site/notes/About|About]]

The above should look like this
```markdown
![Pasted image 20250322211428](/src/site/img/Pasted%20image%2020250322211428.png)
```
![Pasted image 20250322211428](/src/site/img/Pasted%20image%2020250322211428.png)
--------
###### Troubleshooting

I can see the path for my image works when I start from  `site/` as my root folder. 
so then... maybe
```markdown
![[notes/About.md]]
```
This should work

![[notes/About.md]]

------------
###### Still Wrong
I was trying to copy the syntax from my [[scp]] page
```markdown
![Pasted image 20221111014337.png](/src/site/img/Pasted%20image%2020221111014337.png)
```
where that produces the correct image
![Pasted image 20221111014337.png](/src/site/img/Pasted%20image%2020221111014337.png)

---------------

###### I think I see the problem
I need to use single brackets
```markdown
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](img\user\raw_notes\Images\Pasted image 20250322211428.png)

```
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](img\user\raw_notes\Images\Pasted image 20250322211428.png)

###### And the other problem
just noticed there's a leading slash, and the slashes in the path are facing the other way T_T
```markdown
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](/src/site/img/Pasted%20image%2020250322211428.png)
```
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](/src/site/img/Pasted%20image%2020250322211428.png)

So now the link to the image works when using `[]` single brackets and the direct path. another thing that cursor AI pointed out is that files with spaces in the name replace the space with `%20`

###### Another attempt at transcluding
Gonna try to transclude the about page
![[About]]
didn't work

how bout 
```markdown
![src/site/notes/About.md](/src/site/notes/About.md)
```
![src/site/notes/About.md](/src/site/notes/About.md)

that didn't work either. maybe 
```markdown
![About.md](/src/site/notes/About.md)
```
![About.md](/src/site/notes/About.md)

---------
###### Let's try with the permalink
The About page has `"permalink":"/about/"` in its frontmatter, so maybe:
```markdown
![About](/about/)
```
![About](/about/)

---------
###### Let's try with the dg-path
The [[About\|About]] page has `"dg-path"` in its frontmatter, so let's try that format:

First, using the dg-path:
![[about/]]

Or using the permalink:
![[/about/]]

Or using the relative path from notes:
![[About]]
![[About\|About]]
Or the full path:
![[src/site/notes/About]]

Or with the .md extension:
![[src/site/notes/About.md]]

------------

###### Maybe it's because they're in different folders
what if I try transcluding yesterday's note? It's in the same folder as this one.

Let's try a few ways:

1. Simple reference:
![[2025-03-21]]

2. With section reference:
![[2025-03-21#Transitioning from supermemo]]

3. With relative path in same folder:
![[Daily Notes/2025-03-21]]

4. With permalink from frontmatter:
![[/daily-notes/2025-03-21/]]

5. With dg-path from frontmatter:
![[Daily Notes/2025-03-21]]

>[!fail] Transclusions don't work with this site
> I'm not sure what else to try at this point. 
> I may move to a different deployment solution in the future.
