# Fixed Build Errors in Digital Garden

Today I fixed several critical build errors in the digital garden:

## 1. Permalink Conflicts
The main issue was that multiple files were trying to write to the same output path (`dist/file/index.html`). This was happening because several notes had `permalink: /file/` in their frontmatter, even though they were marked as not published (`dg-publish: false`):

- `rangerschool/25405001531RS.md`
- `25405212211linux.md`
- `25405213405CY.md`
- `25405215534CY.md`
- `25405222022CY.md`
- `rangerschool/25404212849RS.md`
- `rangerschool/25404225038RS.md`

This suggests that unpublished notes were still being processed during the build, which shouldn't happen. The fix addresses both the permalink conflict and ensures proper handling of unpublished notes.

### The Fix
Modified `notes.11tydata.js` to implement a smarter permalink generation system:

1. Files in subdirectories keep their structure:
   ```javascript
   if (filePath.includes('/rangerschool/')) {
     return `/rangerschool/${fileName}/`;
   }
   ```

2. Files are categorized by their suffix:
   - `CY` -> `/cybersecurity/`
   - `RS` -> `/rangerschool/`
   - `AI` -> `/ai/`
   - `linux` -> `/linux/`

3. Frontmatter permalinks are only used if they:
   - Are not `/file/` (which was causing conflicts)
   - End with a slash (for consistency)

4. All other files default to `/notes/filename/`

## 2. Async Template Issues
Fixed an error with Eleventy's template processing:
```
Unfortunately you're using code that monkey patched some Eleventy internals and it isn't async-friendly. Change your code to use the async `read()` method on the template instead!
```

### The Fix
1. Made graph generation properly async in `graph.js`
2. Added proper null checks for data objects
3. Improved error handling throughout the permalink generation

## 3. Code Organization
The permalink generation code is now more robust:
```javascript
permalink: (data) => {
  // Handle undefined data
  if (!data || !data.page) {
    console.warn('Data or page object is undefined');
    return '/notes/undefined/';
  }

  // Handle garden entry
  if (data.tags && data.tags.indexOf("gardenEntry") != -1) {
    return "/";
  }

  // Get file info
  const filePath = data.page.filePathStem || data.page.inputPath || '';
  const fileName = path.basename(filePath).replace(/\.md$/, '');
  
  // Category-based routing
  if (filePath.includes('/rangerschool/')) return `/rangerschool/${fileName}/`;
  if (fileName.endsWith('CY')) return `/cybersecurity/${fileName}/`;
  if (fileName.endsWith('RS')) return `/rangerschool/${fileName}/`;
  if (fileName.endsWith('AI')) return `/ai/${fileName}/`;
  if (fileName.match(/linux$/i)) return `/linux/${fileName}/`;

  // Valid frontmatter permalinks
  if (data.permalink && 
      data.permalink !== '/file/' && 
      data.permalink.endsWith('/')) {
    return data.permalink;
  }

  // Default case
  return `/notes/${fileName}/`;
}
```

## 4. Unpublished Notes Fix
Fixed the issue with unpublished notes being processed during the build. Modified `collections.js` to properly filter out notes with `dg-publish: false`:

```javascript
function sortNotes(collection) {
  return collection.getFilteredByTag("note")
    // Filter out unpublished notes
    .filter(note => {
      // Check if note should be published
      const shouldPublish = note.data['dg-publish'] === true;
      if (!shouldPublish) {
        console.log(`Skipping unpublished note: ${note.filePathStem}`);
      }
      return shouldPublish;
    })
    .sort((a, b) => {
      // Sort daily notes by date
      // ... rest of sorting logic ...
    });
}
```

This ensures that:
1. Only notes with `dg-publish: true` are included in the build
2. Unpublished notes are logged for debugging
3. The permalink conflicts are prevented at the source

## Results
- No more duplicate permalink errors
- Proper async handling in templates
- More organized URL structure based on file categories
- Better error handling and logging
- Proper handling of unpublished notes
- Clear logging of skipped unpublished notes
