Kwame Nkrumah was Ghana's first prime minister and president. He developed a philosophical framework focusing on African liberation and social justice.

## Consciencism

**Philosophical consciencism** is the map in intellectual terms of the disposition of forces which enable African society to take in foreign elements in Africa and develop them so they fit with the African personality.

The first step is a body of connected thought that determines the nature of our actions in unifying society. 

The principles of capitalism are in conflict with the socialist egalitarianism of the traditional African society.

### ethical rules are not permanent. 
They depend on the stage reached in the historical evolution of a society, so the cardinal principles of egalitarianism are conserved.  A society can only change its ethics by changing its principles.  

## Pan-African Philosophy
The emancipation of the African continent requires two aims
* the restitution of the egalitarianism of human society
* the logistic mobilization toward gaining that restitution
