**Exclusive Clustering** – In exclusive clustering, one datum belongs to a definite cluster. The data samples are grouped in such a way so that a certain datum belongs to only one cluster.  

**Fuzzy Clustering –** In Fuzzy clustering, data samples are allowed to belong to two or more clusters. Data samples do not belong exclusively to a well defined cluster. The membership function for fuzzy clustering also follows a smoother line to indicate that every sample may belong to several clusters with different degrees.  

**Hierarchical Clustering –** In hierarchical clustering, unions between clusters nearest to each other are found in addition to the clusters themselves.
