# info page
The `info` command is like the cooler, more hip cousin of the `man` command. It provides a more user-friendly and interactive way to access documentation for various commands and topics. Think of it as a hypertext-based documentation system that allows you to navigate through pages, follow links, and search for specific information.

If you can't remember the name of a command but you know what it does, you can use the [[202503271756|apropos]] command to search through `info` descriptions and give a list of related commands.
